# AngularExperiments

Hi everyone, my name is Shwetha and this repo was built in the interest of explaining how easy and straightforward it is to build your own style library. It also serves as a playground for me to experiment with latest and greatest in Angular. I want this to be a place where we can collaborate and experiment, and hence I invite you to come along and try new things with me.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.8.

## SCSS structure and principles

I have used the Atomic Design principle for folder organisation and component structuring along with BEM naming convention and SCSS best practices. Feel free to explore, create PRs or just get in touch if you have any questions!

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
